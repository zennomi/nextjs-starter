## Built with Kaide

Nizam is designed and powered by [Kaide](https://github.com/omergulcicek/kaide), an AI-native architecture kit for modern React. The governance layer that ships with Nizam—`.cursor/rules`, `docs/`, and `AGENTS.md`—is derived from Kaide and is included by default; no extra setup is required. For the upstream project, updates, or to use Kaide in other codebases, see the [Kaide repository](https://github.com/omergulcicek/kaide).

## AI-Ready Architecture

Nizam is fully aligned with 2026 AI-driven development standards. It is built on [Kaide](https://github.com/omergulcicek/kaide) (see **Built with Kaide** above). So that AI agents (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) can understand the project in seconds, it includes the following optimizations:

- **.cursor/rules**: Project-specific rules ensure that when coding with AI assistance, Nizam’s architectural conventions stay consistent.

## Why No Auth or Testing?

Nizam aims to stay minimalist and lightweight instead of shipping an “everything included” bundle. Unlike many boilerplates, we deliberately omit Auth and Testing layers:

- **Flexibility**: Every project has different needs for Auth (Clerk, Auth.js, etc.) or Testing (Vitest, Playwright). Nizam does not lock you into one choice; it gives you a clean foundation.
- **Zero bloat**: The project stays lean and avoids dependencies you may never use.
- **Fast start**: Skip unnecessary setup and focus on business logic from day one.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow the steps below.

### Requirements

- Node.js 22+ and npm (or pnpm/yarn)

### Installation

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/omergulcicek/nizam my-project
cd my-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Environment Variables

The project uses some variables validated at runtime. Create a `.env` file in the root and define at least the following:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

The variable schema is defined in `src/env.ts`.

## Customization

You can quickly tailor the Next.js Boilerplate to your needs by searching the project for `FIXME:` tags.

- `.env`: runtime environment variables
- `src/env.ts`: environment variables schema (required/optional fields)
- `src/app/robots.ts`: Robots.txt configuration for search engines
- `src/app/sitemap.ts`: Dynamic sitemap generation for SEO
- `src/config/site.config.ts`: site name, description, URL, social accounts, locale
- `src/config/seo.config.ts`: Metadata-based SEO settings (title, description, Open Graph, Twitter)
- `src/lib/api.ts`: Axios instance and request helpers based on `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`

## Tips & Recommendations

- **Cursor rules (for Cursor users)**: This repository centralizes AI/editor collaboration rules in `.cursor/rules`. Keep rules aligned with the conventions in this README (naming, structure, types, a11y, styling).

- **Cookies (server-side)**: Use Next.js App Router APIs for cookies.
  - `cookies()` from `next/headers` (read/write in server components/actions)
  - `NextResponse.cookies.set` in route handlers/middleware
  - Docs: `https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies`

- **Helpers (formatting & slug)**:
  - Date formatting: `src/lib/date.ts`
  - Slug generation: `@sindresorhus/slugify`

- **Useful hooks (`usehooks-ts`)**: Recommended utilities for common needs
  - `useLocalStorage`, `useSessionStorage`
  - `useMediaQuery`
  - `useDebounceValue`
  - `useOnClickOutside`
  - `useCopyToClipboard`

### Imports & Aliases

- Prefer short aliases with barrel exports for consistency and readability:
  - `@/ui`, `@/hooks`, `@/data`, `@/schemas`, `@/layout`
- Example:

```ts
import { useUsers } from "@/hooks";

import { Button } from "@/ui";
```

- Longer forms like `@/components/ui` are supported but the short aliases above are recommended.
